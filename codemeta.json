    "releaseNotes": "v.7.0.0 - 2022-07-25\n\nFeature additions:\nThe evolving SPARC Dataset Structure (SDS) all SPARC datasets must follow now includes additional mandatory metadata files. As such, in step 4 of the Organize dataset feature, found in the Prepare Datasets tab, the README.txt file is now mandatory.\nLayout of the Prepare Metadata tab has been changed. Buttons are spread out more evenly and the Manifest files button received an icon change.\nThe Overview page has been overhauled to be more informative and visually stimulating.\nDocumentation and Contact Us tabs added to the navigation bar.\nContact Us tab will provide user information on how to reach out to the team for any issues or suggestions. As well as providing a Gather Logs button for the user to provide in an email for the team to look at any issues in depth.\nVisual overhaul for the prompts that allow users to connect their Pennsieve account with SODA.\nSimplified UI for adding a URL or DOI to a dataset_description.xlsx in the Prepare Metadata tab.\nConverted the SODA server from Zerorpc to Flask.\n\n Bug fixes:\n\nThe option to upload duplicate files to an existing Pennsieve dataset through the Organize Datasets feature no longer causes an error while uploading.\nHidden files can now be imported except .DS_Store and Thumbs.db files.\nThe input for renaming or creating a new dataset no longer references undefined function in its HTML.\nThe navigation buttons in each individual Prepare Metadata section have been updated to match the perceived flow from the Prepare Metadata tab.\nThe Add/edit subtitle feature has been updated so that the chracter limit matches the SDS 2.0 specification. This fixes a bug that would cause an error if a user met the character limit enforced by SODA and then tried to add or edit their subtitle.\n\nKnown Issues:\n\nThere is a bug with removing dataset permissions using both SODA and Pennsieve. If you want to remove your own permission from a dataset, another user with either 'Manager' or 'Owner' permissions must remove you from the dataset. This is an issue with Pennsieve's backend system and will be updated soon.\nWhen uploading a dataset through Upload Local Dataset or Organize Dataset feature to Pennsieve the upload will sometimes freeze. When this occurs it is best to reset the upload and ensure the Pennsieve Agent has been stopped before attempting to upload again. It is also necessary to verify the integrity of uploaded files up to that point. This can be done by simply ensuring all files from folders that have been uploaded are included in the Pennsieve dataset.\nThe Organize Datasets option to upload duplicate files to Pennsieve uploads some duplicates but does not upload all.\nWhen using the Create manifest.xlsx feature any custom columns added to a manifest file stored on Pennsieve will not be imported for editing.\nThe Create manifest.xlsx feature will spawn an error while generating manifest files for a local dataset if there are hidden files in the dataset directory. SODA will not tell the user the cause is the presence of the hidden files.",
